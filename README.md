# PathfinderBuddy
This is a PathfinderBuddy app I developed in Java. The scope of the project is to allow users to create and generate their own characters for the game Pathfinder (Also works for stats in Dungeons and Dragons), it generates the stats the characters will need. This app also comes with a die roller, which prompts you for what sided dice you want to roll, and how many of them!
